## How to use this code
The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a button  ‘Start Quiz’, Also in the top-right corner button to reset the quiz.

Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value = 0 and immediately begins counting. 

Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (10 seconds are subtracted from the remaining time).

When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in `localStorage`.
